class A
{
String s = "MMM";

void methodA()
{
System.out.println(s);
}

static class B
{
void methodB()
{
methodA();
}
}
}

Answer:
The above code is incorrect.
Since it holds the non static methodA() within nested static classB.
As a result it cannot be accessed directly. 
Outer class has to be instantiated first for this.
